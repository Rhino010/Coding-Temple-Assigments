    <h1>A quick peek at my Family and I
        <h2>
            I am a family man who has spent most of my time working in the bar/restaraunt industry. I have held every position in the industry
            including owning a bar and grill in Oshkosh, WI with my business partner Pete. My family and I decided to give it up as well
            as Wisconsin winters and move to Northwest Arkansas to get a fresh start and start on our dream of homesteading. We now have 60 acres
            on a mountain in West Fork, AR. We are truly blessed to be able to take this journey together and are learning a ton every day. Now,
            with the help of Coding Temple I hope to fulfill my other dream of working in the tech industry specifically software engineering.
            Tech of every kind has always intrigued me. I originally went to school with the intention of getting a computer science degree, 
            and after spending 2.5 years studying spanish I got "real close" to acheiving my goal...lol. Now my spanish comes in handy 
            while joking with my coworkers even though they all speak english as well. My days are spent learning about blockchain 
            technology from the investment side, going to the gym, caring for our 60 acre property and animals.
